This section of the manual is still under development.

If you're using the OVMS v3 modem GNSS/GPS satellite tracking receiver, this component can also set the time/date of your system once it has proper satellite reception.

You will want to ensure that the timezone is properly set ; either via the :any:`Web Interface <installation-vehicle-configuration>`, or with the :doc:`configuration`::

  OVMS# config set vehicle timezone XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
